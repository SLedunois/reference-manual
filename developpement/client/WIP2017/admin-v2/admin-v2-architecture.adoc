This document presents the Admin v2 project architecture. Document objective is to help developers understand the Admin v2 project files organization and source code architecture in order to get familiar with it and facilitate new admin v2 developer insertion.

== Project Repository

Admin v2 app is located in Entcore github repository:

URL::
+
....
https://github.com/entcore/entcore
....

Branch::
+
....
admin-v2
....

== Files Structure

=== Root Folder

Admin v2 app resides inside *entcore* project, in *admin* folder:

....
entcore/admin
....

=== Dependencies

Needed dependencies for development and app execution (like Angular, TypeScript, Gulp, ...) are listed in:

....
entcore/package.json
....

=== Build Files

Admin v2 is bundled using *Webpack 2* and built through *Gulp* tasks. 

NOTE: Build process is described here: https://github.com/web-education/reference-manual/blob/dev-front-WIP2017/first-steps/admin-v2-build-process.adoc

==== Entcore Build File

As part of Entcore project, Admin v2 can be built using Entcore build process, based on *Gulp*. The main *gulpfile* is located here:

....
entcore/gulpfile.js
....

It contains the main *build* task, that builds all entcore front apps *including admin v2*.

==== Admin V2 Build Files

Admin v2 can also be built *independently* from Entcore by using Admin v2 specific tasks. Admin v2 specific *gulpfile* is located here:

....
entcore/admin/gulpfile.admin.js
....

It contains specific admin-v2 tasks:

clean:: clean generated files

build-dev:: build app, *dev* mode, see *webpack* configuration file _entcore/admin/webpack.config.dev.js_

build:: build app, *production* mode, see configuration file _entcore/admin/webpack.config.prod.js_

devserver:: build app and start a server supporting *hot reload*, configuration can be found in _entcore/admin/webpack.config.devserver.js_

watch:: copy resources files to springboard. Configure _springboardPath_ variable in _entcore/admin/gulpfile.admin.js_ to adjust your springboard path.

=== Resources

Resources root folder:

....
entcore/admin/src/main/resources
....

==== Styles & Fonts

....
resources/
    public/
        styles/
            admin.scss <1>
            flatpickr-confetti.css <2>

            font-awesome-4.7.0/ <4>
....

<1> Main SASS file: contains admin v2 styles. SASS file is compiled into CSS during  build phase (see file: _entcore/admin/webpack.config.common.js_ for more details)
<2> Datepicker CSS file, this file is *generated during build phase* (see _copy-flatpickr-css_ task in file _entcore/admin/gulpfile.admin.js_)
<3> Generic icons lib, see: https://github.com/entcore/generic-icons for more details
<4> Font Awesome icons

==== I18n

        en.json <1>
        fr.json <2>
....

<1> Admin v2 is not yet translated in English
<2> French file, contains all labels keys and values

=== TypeScript

TypeScript files are located in:

....
entcore/admin/src/main/ts
....

TypeScript files structure overview:

....
ts/
    app/ <1>
    libs/ <2>
    main.aot.ts <3>
    main.ts <4>
    tsconfig.aot.json <5>
    tsconfig.json <6>
....

<1> *app/*: app source code root, see <<App Architecture>> for more details
<2> *libs/*: contains vendors imports for webpack bundle
<3> *main.aot.ts*: angular bootstrap for AOT mode (see: https://angular.io/guide/aot-compiler for more details on  AOT compilation)
<4> *main.ts*: angular bootstrap for dev mode
<5> *tsconfig.aot.json*: typescript configuration for *production* mode -> *AOT* compilation
<6> *tsconfig.json*: typescript configuration for *dev* mode

== App Architecture

App source code structure:

....
ts/
    app/
        core/ ................... core module (nav, resolvers, services, stores)
        groups/ ................. groups module (routing, resolvers, components)
        shared/ ................. shared module (UX components)
        structure/ .............. structure module (routing, resolvers, components)
        users/ .................. users module (routing, resolvers, components)
        app-home.component.ts ... app home component
        app-routing.module.ts ... app routing
        app.component.ts ........ app component (outlet for router)
        app.module.ts ........... app module
....

Admin v2 source code is splitted in Angular modules:

* *app* module
* *core* module
* *groups* module
* *shared* module
* *structure* module
* *users* module
* ... more modules to come :)

Each module contains its specifics *components*, *routing*, *resolvers*, and *stores*

The following section presents an overview of each module content:

=== App Module

....
app/app.module.ts
....

App module is the *main* module, *loaded by Angular bootstrap*.

App module contains all needed components and routing to display app home page.

App module lazy loads Structure module when a user clicks on a structure in structures tree.

==== App Components

===== App

....
app/app.component.ts
....

Bootstraped when module is loaded, it holds the *main router outlet*

===== AppHome

....
app/app-home.component.ts
....

Loaded by the main route */admin*, it displays app *home page message*:

image::home-msg.png[Home message]

NOTE: Navigation header is handled by Navigation Component from Core Module, see <<NavigationComponent, Navigation Component>>

==== App Routing

....
app/app-routing.module.ts
....

Routing paths:

/admin:: Loads NavComponent (from Core module) and AppHomeComponent. Plus, fetches *User session information* and *Structures list* through *Resolvers* (_SessionResolve_ and _StructuresResolve_ from Core module).

/admin/:structureId:: Lazy load <<Structure Module>>. More info about lazy loading here: https://angular.io/guide/ngmodule#lazy-loading-modules-with-the-router

==== App Services

App module uses Services from Core Module, see <<Core Services>> section to learn more about it.

==== App Stores

App module uses *Global Store* from Core Module, see <<Global Store>> section to learn more about it.

=== Core Module

....
app/core/core.module.ts
....

Imported by App module, Core module contains app core elements:

* Navigation Component
* Services
* Resolvers
* Stores

IMPORTANT: Core module should only be imported by App module, to prevent side effects. A guard has been implemented to prevent this, see file: app/core/module-import-guard.ts

==== Core Components

[[NavigationComponent]]
===== Nav

....
app/core/nav/nav.component.ts
....

Loaded by the main route */admin*, it displays *nav header*:

image::nav-component1.png[Nav header]

and *structures tree*:

image::nav-component2.png[Structure tree]

==== Core Services

===== Spinner

....
app/core/services/spinner.service.ts
....

Displays spinner while performing asynchonous task:

image::spinner.png[Spinner]

Usage:

[source,js]
----
loadingService.perform('<spinner-placeholder>', <asynchronous-task>)
    .then()
    .catch()
----

Loading service is used in combination with a *spinner-cube* tag in a component:

[source,html]
----
<spinner-cube class="portal-spinner" waitingFor="portal-content"></spinner-cube>
----

where _waitingFor_ attribute matches _<spinner-placeholder>_. 

TIP: There is a spinner-cube tag in _app/core/nav/nav.component.ts_

===== Notify

....
app/core/services/notify.service.ts
....

Displays Success/Error notification after user action:

image::notify-success.png[Notify success]
image::notify-error.png[Notify error]

Usage:

[source,js]
----
notifyService.success(
    {   key: '<content-i18n-key>', 
        parameters: { user: this.user}
    }, '<title-i18n-key>')
)
----

will display a succesful notification pop-up for successful operation. 

Notify service also provides an error function to display error pop-up for failed operation.

===== Plateforme-info

....
app/core/services/plateforme-info.service.ts
....

Provides plateforme information, for example: is sms module enabled?

===== Profiles

....
app/core/services/profiles.service.ts
....

Gets User profiles list.

===== Userlist Filters

....
app/core/services/userlist.filters.service.ts
....

Services for User list filters, see https://github.com/web-education/reference-manual/blob/dev-front-WIP2017/first-steps/admin-v2-howto-addUserFilter.adoc to know how to add a new user filter.

===== Userlist

....
app/core/services/userlist.service.ts
....

Provides utils functions for *sorting*, *filtering*, *paging* a user list.

==== Core Resolvers

Resolvers are used by routing to fetch data needed by components before they are initialized. See https://angular.io/api/router/Resolve for more details about Angular Resolvers.

===== Session Resolver

....
app/core/resolvers/session.resolve.ts
....

Gets user session information and stores it in Angular route data.

Usage:

Resolver is called by route /admin in app routing:

....
path: 'admin', resolve: { session: SessionResolve }
....

where _session_ is the storing Angular route data attribute.

Then Navigation component retrieves information using Angular route data:

....
this.session = this.route.snapshot.data['session']
....

===== Structures Resolver

....
app/core/resolvers/structures.resolve.ts
....

Syncs structures collection in Core <<Global Store>>.

Usage:

Resolver is called by route /admin in app routing:

....
path: 'admin', resolve: { StructuresResolve }
....

Resolver syncs structures collection in Core Global Store:

....
globalStore.structures.sync()
....

Then Navigation component retrieves structures from Global Store as a structures tree:

....
this.structures = globalStore.structures.asTree()
....

===== I18n Resolver

....
app/core/resolvers/i18n.resolve.ts
....

Loads i18n files bundle: fr.json, en.json...

Usage:

Resolver is called by route /admin in app routing:

....
path: 'admin', resolve: { I18nResolve }
....

==== Core Stores

===== Abstract Store

....
app/core/store/abstract.store.ts
....

Abstract Store is the app Data Stores root class. It adds an observable to store attributes to trigger attribute changes -> useful to detect when a store element has changed and do something accordingly

===== Global Store

....
app/core/store/global.store.ts
....

Extends Abstract Store. It contains the Structures Collection. Global store is used to retrieve structures collection. Example:

[source,js]
----
import { globalStore } from 'path/to/store'

let structures = globalStore.structures.data
----

=== Structure Module

Structure module root folder:

....
app/structure
....

Structure module is defined in file:

....
app/structure/structure.module.ts
....

Structure module is *lazy loaded* by App router for route */admin/:structureId* (user picked a structure in the list).

Structure module contains all needed components, routing and resolvers for displaying structure information.

Structure module routing lazy loads <<Users Module>> and <<Groups Module>> when user clicks on User menu and Groups menu.

TIP: Structure module contains router outlet for displaying related users and groups.

==== Structure Components

===== Structure

....
app/structure/structure.component.ts
....

Loaded by route */admin/:structureId*, Structure component hosts the router outlet for StructureHome component and related Users and Groups module.

===== StructureHome

....
app/structure/structure-home.component.ts
....

Loaded by route */admin/:structureId* (as child), StructureHome component displays *structure home page*:

image::structure-home.png[Structure home]

Cards are handled by following components:

===== QuickActionsCard

....
app/structure/cards/quick-actions-card.component.ts
....

Card *Quick actions* displays links to actions: 

* create user
* create group
* handle duplicate users
* handle signals

===== UserSearchCard

....
app/structure/cards/user-search-card.component.ts
....

Card *User search* displays a user search input.

===== ImportsExportsCard

....
app/structure/cards/imports-exports-card.component.ts
....

Card *Import/Export* gives access to import export utilities.

===== StructureCard

....
app/structure/cards/structure-card.component.ts
....

Card *Structure* gives access to manage connectors, widgets and applications.

==== Structure Routing

....
app/structure/structure-routing.module.ts
....

Routing paths:

/admin/:structureId:: Loads Structure and StructureHome components. Plus, fetches Structure information through *StructureResolver*:
+
* Classes
* Groups
* User Profiles
* Import Sources
* AAF functions

/admin/:structureId/users:: Lazy loads <<Users Module>>

/admin/:structureId/groups:: Lazy loads <<Groups Module>>

==== Structure Resolvers

....
app/structure/structure.resolve.ts
....

Fetches structure information and stores it in Angular route data structure attribute.

Usage:

Resolver is called by route /admin/:structureId in structure routing:

....
path: '', component: StructureComponent, resolve: { structure: StructureResolve }
....

where _session_ is the storing Angular route data attribute.

Then StructureHome component retrieves information using an Observable on the route:

[source,js]
....
this.routeSubscriber = this.route.data.subscribe(data => {
    this.structure = data['structure']
    this.cdRef.markForCheck()
})
....

IMPORTANT: Do not confuse with <<Structures Resolver>> which fetches structures collection.

==== Structure Stores

No specific Store for Structure Module.

=== Users Module

Users module root folder:

....
app/users
....

Users module is defined in file:

....
app/users/users.module.ts
....

Users module is *lazy loaded* by structure router for route */admin/:structureId/users* (after user clicked in Users icon in nav header)

Users module contains all needed components, routing and resolvers for displaying users information.

Users module components are displayed in structure router-outlet defined in Structure Component (app/structure/structure.component.ts).

==== Users Components

[[UsersComponent]]
===== Users

....
app/users/users.component.ts
....

Loaded by route */admin/:structureId/users*, it is Users module *root component*. 

It contains the *router outlet* for Users components.

It defines Users module page layout:

* Users module header: title + create user button,
* Users module body: <<UserListComponent, UserList component>> on left side and <<UserDetailsComponent, UserDetails>> or <<UserCreateComponent, UserCreate>> or <<UserFiltersComponent, UserFilters>> components on the right side:
+
image::users-root.png[Users component]

TIP: Users component saves selected user in <<Users Store>> after user clicked on user in user list.

....

Loaded by <<UsersComponent, Users component>>, it displays current structure users list:

image::users-list.png[Users list]

[[UserDetailsComponent]]
===== UserDetail

....
app/users/details/user-details.component.ts
....

Loaded by route */admin/:structureId/users/:userId*, it displays user details:
