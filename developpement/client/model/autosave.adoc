Autosave

Sometimes, a good interface will allow the user to make a variety of changes 
and save modifications without having to click on a save button. 
The Autosave functionality will save modifications only when the object being watched 
has changed. The differentiation is based on the toJSON return value, 
as it’s the value actually being sent to the server (other property won’t be saved anyway). 
The watcher checks for changes every 500 ms.

import { Autosave } from ‘entcore-toolkit’;

// Watching an object
Autosave.watch(‘/path/to/save’, myObj);
// Using a callback instead of a path
Autosave.watch(() => myObj.save(), myObj);
// Stop watching
Autosave.unwatch(myObj);
// Stop all watchers
Autosave.unwatchAll
