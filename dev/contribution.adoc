= Developer contribution guidelines

== Branch organisation

* *master* : the main branch. It stores all the public commit log and tag (mapped to release). 
  It must never be "pushed force".
* *dev* : the next release integration branch.
* *my-topic* : a topic branch for a particular project. It must be rebased as often as possible on dev branch

== 1. Derive _topic_ from _dev_

                                       I---J---K  (topic)
                                      /
                             E---F---G---H  (dev)
                            /
               A---B---C---D  (master)

----

NOTE: Each new evolution projet must be isolated on a dedicated topic branch. 

== 2. Isolation test : Rebase _topic_ on _dev_. Test your evolution

                                           I---J---K---L---M  (topic)
                                          /
                             E---F---G---H  (dev)
                            /
               A---B---C---D  (master)

== 3. Integration test : Merge _topic_ in _dev_. All _dev_'s evolution will be test together

                             E---F---G---H---I---J---K---L---M  (topic, dev)
                            /
               A---B---C---D  master

== 4. Packaging : Merge _dev_ on _master_. Tag the _HEAD_ of _master_ with the next release label 

[source]

               A---B---C---D---E---F---G---H---I---J---K---L---M  (topic, dev, master, NEXT_RELEASE_LABEL)
