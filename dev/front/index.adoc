= Frontend Development

== Getting started

If youâ€™ve used link:https://github.com/entcore/skeletons[skeletons] to initialize your application, you already have a gulpfile, 
a webpack config file, and a npm package file. To start front-end development, 
you first need to install nodeJS 6.11.

https://nodejs.org/en/

Then, you can go in your application folder and install all dependencies:

`npm install`

You will also need to make the gulp command available:

`npm install -g gulp@3.9.1`


== Gulp commands

Two gulp commands are available in your application:

`gulp `build``

will start building your typescript files, bundle them in a single file, 
and add cache-busting utilities. 

WARNING: You need to use gulp build before gradle install,
as Gradle (the server-side build tool) will use your current resources directory.

The second one is

`gulp watch`

This will start a process listening to all changes made to your files, build them and copy them to your springboard directory. You can set your springboard path with the springboard parameter:

`gulp watch --springboard /path/to/my/springboard`

This also works with relative paths:

`gulp watch --springboard ../my/springboard`
