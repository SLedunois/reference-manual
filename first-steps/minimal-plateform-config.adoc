== Import a structure data set

In ODE platform, a structure is typically a school or a grouping of school. 
The user's data loading process is designed around this notion of structure,
because schools are the "master data" of user's identity. 

* Connect with the default super user : `tom.mate` / `password`
* Go to URL : http://localhost:8090/directory/wizard (it's the CSV's import wizard)
* Use the test data set located in `path-tospringboard/sample-be1d/EcoleprimaireEmileZola` folder

Fill the form as described in the screenshot below

* Choose a name for your new school
* Upload files for each user profile :
** `CSVExtraction-eleves.csv` for *Students*
** `CSVExtraction-enseignants.csv` for *Teachers*
** `CSVExtraction-responsables.csv` for *Parents*
* Click *Start import* on Step 2 screen
* Click *Finish* on Step 3 screen (The following message is displayed : "Your import has been successfully completed")

== Configure application roles

In ODE platform, each application provides its set of precise permissions.
You have to group the permissions into high level roles before granting user access.

* Go to http://localhost:8090/appregistry/admin-console
* Chose "*Application roles*" menu
* Enter "_Message_" in the left search field and select the application called "_Messagerie_"

* Name your role "_All_"
* Select all permissions ("_Mailbox: create a draft_" and "_Mailbox: open mailbox_" )
* Press button "Save"

== Grant roles to groups

* Choose "*Roles assigned*" menu
* Select the school called * "_MY DEV SCHOOL_"

* Enter "_MY DEV_" in the second search field
* Select a group (eg. "_All students in group_")

* Choose "*Application roles*" menu
* Enter "_Message_" in left search field and select the application called * "Messagerie_"

TIP: Grant access to all school groups to ease further testing operations. 

== Activate user

As user accounts are batch imported, each user receives an activation code.
When he first logs in, the user has to choose a secret password. 

* Go to http://localhost:8090/directory/admin-console#/
* Choose "*User operations*" menu
* Select the school called * "_MY DEV SCHOOL_"

NOTE: User color depends of his profile. 
Red for Teacher ;
